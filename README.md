# full_adder
This is a synthesis and analysis of basic full adder in digital electronics
This is done by using verilog language in which:

FOR DESIGN:
-assign statement is used which is the  example of continuos blocking assignment where ouput is completely dependent on inputs
-common verilog operators such as &(and) , ^(xor) are used

FOR TESTBENCH:
-monitor statement is used to make the code easy
-various propagation delay are used , it can be set according to need
-inputs are initialized to zero
